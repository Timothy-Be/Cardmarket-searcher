# Cardmarket-searcher
Gives a list of seller with the most cards you want to buy.  I use Selenium to search cardmarket's database via the website to bypass the api.
You just need to put a file named "cards.txt" containing a list of magic cards you want to search for in the same directory as the main.py.

Then start main and optimize to get the list of sellers and cards you should buy from each of them.
